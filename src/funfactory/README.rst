funfactory is what makes `playdoh`_ fun. You import it within a Django
`manage.py`_ file and it sets up the playdoh environment and configures some
settings.

Any substantial part of playdoh's *core* should be contained within funfactory.
However, it is not a collection of standalone apps.
Check out the `playdoh docs`_ for a complete user guide.

Hacking
=======

To develop new features for playdoh core, you'll want to hack on funfactory!
To run the test suite, first install `tox`_ then cd into the root dir
and type the ``tox`` command.  The ``tox.ini`` will handle the rest.

To try out cutting edge funfactory features in a real playdoh app, you can use
the develop command to install a link to the files within your virtualenv::

  workon the-playdoh-clone
  pushd ~/your/path/to/funfactory
  python setup.py develop
  popd

Test Suite Environment
======================

Here are some environment variables that are acknowledged by the test suite:

**FF_DB_USER**
  MySQL db user to run manage.py test. Defaults to ``root``.

**FF_DB_PASS**
  MySQL user password for manage.py test. Defaults to an empty string.
